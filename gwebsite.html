			<h4>Female Monarch</h4>

			<p>Brilliant orange and black monarchs are among the most easily recognizable of the butterfly species which call the Americas home. Their migration takes them as far north as Canada and, during the winter months, as far south as Mexico City. A single monarch can travel hundreds to thousands of miles!</p>
			<p>Monarchs are truly spectacular migrants, because the butterflies know the correct direction to migrate even though they have never made the journey before. They follow an internal "compass" that points them in the right direction each spring and fall. The monarch migration is one of the greatest natural phenomena in the insect world.</p>
