			<h4>Female Monarch</h4>


			<p class="para1">Brilliant orange and black monarchs are among the most easily recognizable of the butterfly species which call the Americas home. Their migration takes them as far north as Canada and, during the winter months, as far south as Mexico City. A single monarch can travel hundreds to thousands of miles!</p>
			<p>Monarchs are truly spectacular migrants, because the butterflies know the correct direction to migrate even though they have never made the journey before. They follow an internal "compass" that points them in the right direction each spring and fall. The monarch migration is one of the greatest natural phenomena in the insect world.</p>

				<h4>Male Monarch</h4>

				<p>Commonly and easily mistaken for the similar viceroy butterfly, the monarch's wingspan ranges from 8.9 to 10.2 centimetres (3.5-4.0 in). The upper side of the wings is tawny-orange, the veins and margins are black, and in the margins are two series of small white spots. Monarch forewings also have a few orange spots near their tips. Wing undersides are similar, but the tips of forewings and hindwings are yellow-brown instead of tawny-orange and the white spots are larger. The shape and color of the wings change at the beginning of the migration and appear redder and more elongated than later migrants. Wings size and shape differ between migratory and non-migratory monarchs. Monarchs from eastern North America have larger and more angular forewings than those in the western population.</p>

				<p>Monarch flight has been described as "slow and sailing". However, startled monarchs often fly quickly.</p>

				<p>Adults exhibit sexual dimorphism. A male has a black patch or spot of androconial scales on each hindwing (in some butterflies, these patches disperse pheromones, but are not known to do so in monarchs), and the black veins on his wings are lighter and narrower than those of females.Males are also slightly larger than females. One variation, the "white monarch"; observed in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and the United States; is called nivosus by lepidopterists. It is grayish-white in all areas of its wings that are normally orange and is only about 1% or less of all monarchs, but populations as high as 10% exist on Oahu in Hawaii.</p>

				<p>The monarch has six legs like all insects, but uses its middle legs and hindlegs as it carries its two forelegs against its body.</p>
